# Typewriter Effect 

## What it is
A simple project that adds a typewriter effect to your text which you can use to beautify your webpage.

## How to make it work: 
1. Clone the directory.
2. Embed the CSS and use the HTML as reference for the part you want the effect to be applied to.
2. Give the text to be beautified an html id of "typewriter-text".
3. Add a cursor "|" right after the the class "typewriter-text" with an id of "cursor".
4. Edit the section below **START READING FROM HERE** in the index.js file to change the original and the final text.
5. You may even change the speed of the typing effect by changing the value for speed in the same section.

## Limitations
The cursor shifts to the the previous line if the text within "typewriter-text" exceeds one line.
